# Dragtime

[Check out the timer here](https://dragtime.netlify.app/).
**To start, just drag any of the zeros up to reveal the controls, and let go at the desired number to set it.** Iâ€™ve always hated the native iOS Timer. The dial that you have to rotate to input your numbers always feels cumbersome and slow. Just a single upward gesture to select the number, and a delay before starting to wait and check for more numbers. I think it excels at quickly inputting arbitrary non-round times. I designed it with mobile in mind, and a quick thumb swipe.
